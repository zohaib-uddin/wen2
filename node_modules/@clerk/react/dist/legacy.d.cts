 * The `useSignIn()` hook provides access to the [`SignIn`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/objects/sign-in) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-in attempt and manage the sign-in flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-in flow](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).

 * ### Check the current state of a sign-in
 *
 * The following example uses the `useSignIn()` hook to access the [`SignIn`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/objects/sign-in) object, which contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.

 *
 * The `useSignIn()` hook can also be used to build fully custom sign-in flows, if Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-in flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `useSignIn()` hook to create custom flows, see the [custom flow guides](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).
